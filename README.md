# Team-10-Mini-Project-Symptomatic-Diagnosis-in-Mental-Health
Symptomatic Diagnosis in Mental Health 🧠
This project aims to classify mental health conditions (Depression, Anxiety, or Normal) from textual input using Machine Learning and NLP techniques.
It also includes a Streamlit web app for real-time prediction.

📘 Project Overview
Early detection of mental health conditions through text data analysis using ensemble learning (Random Forest + Logistic Regression + Decision Tree).

⚙️ Tech Stack
Python, scikit-learn, imblearn, nltk
Streamlit for web app
Ngrok for public deployment
TF-IDF for feature extraction
📊 Model Summary
Used VotingClassifier combining RandomForest, LogisticRegression, and DecisionTree.
Achieved ~93% accuracy overall.
